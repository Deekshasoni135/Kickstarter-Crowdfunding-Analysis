## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to analyze crowdfunding dynamics on platforms like Kickstarter, focusing on key areas such as project success rates, geographic distribution, success based on backer count, and category popularity.


## Data Sources

Crowdfunding data : The primary dataset used for this analysis is the ‚Äúcrowdfunding_data.csv‚Äù file, containing detailed information about project status, backers, geographical data of successful projects, and categories.


## Tools

- **Excel** ‚Äì Used for Data Cleaning  
- **MySQL** ‚Äì Data Analysis  
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Creating KPI‚Äôs and Dashboard


## Data Cleaning

In this phase, I identified and corrected errors in the raw data:
- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized date and category formats
- Corrected erroneous entries


## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the crowdfunding data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the overall successful projects?
- What is the percentage of successful projects by category?
- What is the percentage of successful projects by year, quarter and month?
- Top successful projects based on backers count and Amount raised?


## Data Analysis

Performed comprehensive data analysis using MySQL, focusing on Project status, geographic distribution, and total projects based on category.
- Total number of projects by status
```sql
SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS total_projects 
FROM projects 
GROUP BY state;
```
  
- Geographic distribution of projects
```sql
SELECT location_id,
       COUNT(*) AS total_projects
FROM projects
GROUP BY location_id
ORDER BY total_projects DESC;
```

- Project counts by category
```sql
SELECT category,
       COUNT(*) AS total_projects
FROM projects
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_projects DESC;
```
