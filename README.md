## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Kickstarter crowdfunding data to understand trends, success factors, and key metrics that affect project performance globally. It includes data preprocessing, SQL-based exploration, Excel modeling, and Power BI dashboards for visual insights.

## Business Problem

Kickstarter hosts thousands of crowdfunding campaigns, but only a portion succeed.  
Key questions explored:
- What is the overall success rate?
- Which project categories perform best?
- How does success vary by time and location?
- What makes a project more likely to succeed?

## Data Sources

Crowdfunding data : The primary dataset used for this analysis is the ‚Äúcrowdfunding_data.csv‚Äù file, containing detailed information about project status, backers, geographical data of successful projects, and categories.


## Tools

- **Excel** ‚Äì Data preprocessing, metric calculations, static dashboards  
- **MySQL** ‚Äì Data querying, filtering, and aggregations  
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Visual storytelling, interactive dashboards  
- **Power Query / Pivot Tables** ‚Äì For Excel analysis  
- **DateTime Converter** ‚Äì Epoch to natural time conversion  



## Data Cleaning

In this phase, I identified and corrected errors in the raw data:
- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized date and category formats
- Corrected erroneous entries


## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the crowdfunding data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the overall successful projects?
- What is the percentage of successful projects by category?
- What is the percentage of successful projects by year, quarter and month?
- Top successful projects based on backers count and Amount raised?


## Data Analysis

Performed comprehensive data analysis using MySQL, focusing on Project status, geographic distribution, and total projects based on category.
- Total number of projects by status
```sql
SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS total_projects 
FROM projects 
GROUP BY state;
```
  
- Geographic distribution of projects
```sql
SELECT location_id,
       COUNT(*) AS total_projects
FROM projects
GROUP BY location_id
ORDER BY total_projects DESC;
```

- Project counts by category
```sql
SELECT category,
       COUNT(*) AS total_projects
FROM projects
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_projects DESC;
```

## Power BI Dashboard

Here is a preview of the dashboard that visualizes key insights from the crowdfunding data:

## Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Out of all analyzed crowdfunding campaigns, about **140,310 succeeded**, while **188,240 failed** and **32,500** were **canceled**. This shows the importance of proper planning and community support.

- The **United States** led in campaign volume, highlighting strong engagement with crowdfunding.

- **Top-performing categories** included **Product Design, Music, and Tabletop Games**, reflecting backer interest in innovation and creativity.

- Campaign activity peaked in **2015**, followed by a decline‚Äîsuggesting a need to boost engagement and platform innovation.


## How to run this project?

1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Load the dataset into MySQL and run queries for analysis  
3. Use Excel to clean and summarize results  
4. Connect Tableau to the cleaned dataset (Excel or SQL)  
5. Explore the dashboards and filter by category, year, or location


## Recommendations
To enhance success rates and participation on crowdfunding platforms, consider the following:
- Prioritize popular categories like Product Design and Music, where success rates are higher.
- Expand globally by targeting underrepresented regions with localized content and marketing.
- Support creators pre-launch through evaluation tools, mentorship, and planning resources.
- Boost platform engagement using influencer campaigns, early-bird perks, and launch events.
- Innovate user experience to maintain interest and attract new users.
- Innovate user engagement strategies to boost participation and interest.
